Files from this directory allow you to reproduce the scRNA-seq analysis of sponge Halisarca dujardinii (from
"THE DIVERGENT INTRON-CONTAINING ACTIN IN SPONGE MORPHOGENETIC PROCESSES" by Yulia V. Lyupina, Kim I. Adameyko, Vasiliy M. Zubarev et al.)

"Seurat_scGate_analysis.Rmd" takes raw files from CellRanger (see CellRanger_results directory) and yields .H5Seurat and .h5ad objects with clustering and UMAP projections. 

"HDuj_annotated_celltypes_20240523.h5Seurat", "HDuj_reclustered_renumbered_20240522.h5ad" is result of this script, the last can be used with scanpy.

"SAMap.ipynb" takes .h5ad and additional files of Spongilla lacustris and Amphimedon queenslandica to apply SAMap cell type mapping algorithm.
To obtain files for other sponges, see data availability in articles:
Musser,J.M., Schippers,K.J., Nickel,M. et al. (2021) Profiling cellular diversity in sponges informs animal cell type and nervous system evolution. Science, 374, 717–723.
Sebé-Pedrós,A., Chomsky,E., Pang,K. et al. (2018) Early metazoan cell type diversity and the evolution of multicellular gene regulation. Nat. Ecol. Evol., 2, 1176–1188.

"SAMap.ipynb" results in cell type similarity matrices: mapping_table_small_hd_aq.csv; mapping_table_small_hd_sl.csv.
These similarity matrices can be utilized to make sankey plots with "Sankey.Rmd"

"counts_hd_235r_4seasons_exons_v2.rds" is R dataset which contains read counts of bulk RNA-seq.

"Cell type deconvolution analysis.Rmd" takes both bulk RNA-seq dataset and .h5Seurat object to do cell type deconvolution analysis. 
It produces file "Deconv_3k_marker_based_predicted_stage_fixed_season_random.tsv" with estimated proportion of cell types in bulk RNA-seq samples.
For proper work it requires a table with huge set of cell type marker genes as well as some info to interconvert various versions of gene IDs. 
it is included in files: "markers_top_v20240405.rds"; "Trinotate_annotation_report.xlsx"

Finally, "Actin_paper_figures_20250120.ipynb" allows to reproduce those plots from the article which were created using this data.
